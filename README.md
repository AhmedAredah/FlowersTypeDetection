# AI Programming with Python Project
by Ahmed Aredah

This project is part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students develop the following:
1. code for an image classifier built with PyTorch
2. convert the program into a command line application.

# Prerequisites

The project requires python 3.x and the following packages, make sure you have them installed.

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [Pytorch and Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/)
- [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1/)


# Provided Files and Code

The project consists of two parts
1. A standalone Jupyter Notebook,
2. Two-python files; train.py and predict.py with full functionality of training on a custom dataset or predicting using our own, and
3. A flowers dataset; it is downloadable from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz).

## 1. A standalone Jupyter Notebook

To run the file, make sure you have jupyter installed first. the file needs access to your computer storage since it reads and writes to your local storage desk drive.

## 2. Two-python files

The files are command enabled files with optional arguments like --epochs number.
The training model used is VGG16 with only 2 layers. Customize the file for better trainig if you need to incread the hidden layers number.

## 3. flowers dataset

The dataset is required for the training purposes only. yet you can use your dataset with keeping the same folder structure.
